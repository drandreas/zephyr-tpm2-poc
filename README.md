# Proof of Concept: Zepher TPM2 Software Stack

## Overview
This repo tests the requirements (Code size and Memory size) for running
tpm2-tss on [Zephyr](https://www.zephyrproject.org). The PoC is implemented
on top of the Enhanced System API (ESAPI), since the Feature API (FAPI)
adds additional dependencies to JSON-C and OpenSSL. Moreover, the
[tpm2-tools](https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tools) are also implemented
on top of ESAPI, therefore the ESAPI should be sufficient. This PoC does not
yet implement an engine for mbedtls, it instead just runs a selection of ESYS
integration tests that should cover all API required when implementing an
engine for mbedtls:

- esys-get-random
- esys-rsa-encrypt-decrypt
- esys-ecdh-keygen
- esys-certify-creation
- esys-verify-signature

## Hardware Requirements
The PoC is tested with an [Infineon SLB 9670 TPM2.0 Arduino HAT](https://buyzero.de/products/arduino-adapter-for-letstrust-tpm)
on an [NXP FRDM-K64F](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/arm/frdm_k64f/doc/index.html)
but should work with any MCU - TPM 2.0 combination as long as the SPI-subsystem
does not release the chip-select between consecutive transfers.
